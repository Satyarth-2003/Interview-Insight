## Features

1. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**  
   - Converts spoken answers into text for analysis using advanced speech recognition models.

2. **Facial Emotion Detection**  
   - Uses computer vision to identify emotions and analyze non-verbal cues during responses.

3. **Response Analysis**  
   - Evaluates the content of answers using natural language processing (NLP) to provide feedback on relevance, structure, and clarity.

4. **Real-Time Feedback**  
   - Provides actionable insights to improve communication and emotional alignment in interviews.
